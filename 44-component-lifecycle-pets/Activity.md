# Pre-Lecture Activity

https://github.com/helloRupa/react-pets-activity/blob/master/README.md

Look at the screenshot of the React Animal Shelter. 

On a piece of paper or using an image editor (Preview will also work), draw boxes around the different parts of the UI. 

Next, label those parts with meaningful names, i.e. the names you would use for Components in React.

Lastly, draw a diagram (flowchart), or list out the structure of the App (using tabs). 

Example of an App's structure using a list (asterisk * denotes there could be many of these components):

- <App />
    - <RobotsMenu />
        - <MenuItem /> *
    - <Robots />
        - <SortOptions />
        - <Robot /> *
    - <Footer />
