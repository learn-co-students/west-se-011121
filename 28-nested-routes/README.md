- Helps us more easily display assosicated data.
- Helps keep our code DRY by logically nesting resources together.
- Views become more dynamic and reuseable.
- Creates a better user experience.
- When implemented well, nested routes can help create a user experiences that much more logical or natural.
- Nested routes can also make life much easier when we get into creating and editing associated data. Which we'll take a look at a little later.
