## Auth with JWT

- what are JSON Web Tokens
- using JWT gem on Rails API to create and decode JWTs
- building out controller actions to implement the above
- where to store the token on the client?
    - state vs. localStorage
- first implemented in state, then moved to localStorage
- logout clears all tokens and user data
